Hi, This is one of my unique projects in HTML and CSS. Here I am designing a frontend web page like youtube. For this project, I am using some advanced CSS techniques: CSS grid, flex-box, positioning, Tooltip, and many things. From this project, I have learned a lot of CSS properties that help me to build more realistic and effective projects in the future insha-Allah. Thank you.
